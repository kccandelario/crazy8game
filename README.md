Project work for F hr in Term 16-2, CS403 

Crazy 8's:

Equipment:
The only required equipment for the game is a 
standard deck of playing cards. The deck consists of 52 cards.
Each has a face value determined y a unique pairing of suit and 
number. Each suit is represented by a geometric shape. There are 
four suits, hearts, dimands, spades, and clubs. Their are 13 numbers
ranging from 1 to 13. 1 is represented by the letter A. 11, 12 and 13
are represented by the letters J, Q, and K respectively. Numbers 2
through 10 are represented by their respective digits.  
 
 
 Playing Area:
 
 The playing area consists of the draw pile, the discard pile and the
 four hands consisting of each player's cards respectively.
 
 Winning Conditions: 
 The first player to remove all cards from his/her hand into the
 discard pile wins the game.
 
 Rules:
 At the beginning of the game each player starts with seven cards in
 their hand. Player can see the face value of the cards in
 their hand but not the values of the other players' hands
 Initially the discard pile has one card in it and all players are
 can see the face value. The remaining cards are in the draw pile,
 none of the face values in the draw pile are made available to the
 players. The players take turns removing one card from their hand 
 and placing it at the top of the discard pile. Once a card is 
 placed on the discard pile its value is visible to all players
 and the card it was place on is no longer seen as the placed card
 covers it up. In order for a card to be placed on the discard pile
 it must either have the same suit as the top card in the discard
 pile or it must have the same number. If a player does not have a
 card that he/she can place during their turn, that player must
 take a card from the draw pile and place it in their hand. If the
 player can play this new card then the player will move it into 
 the discard pile and it will be the next players turn. However, if 
 the player cannot then the player must again take a card from the 
 draw pile and place it in their hand. If the player cannot play that
 card either, the player must continue taking cards until they get
 a card that they can place in the discard pile.
 Special Rule:
 Any card with the number 8 on it is a wild card, and can be placed
 on top of any card regardless of the suit. The player who played
 the 8 then chooses the suit that the next player must match 
 regardless of what the suit that the 8 card has.
